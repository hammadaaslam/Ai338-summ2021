As AI is based on different machine learning algorithms. We have also learned different machine learning algorithms to find best accuracy score by different methods like multinomial and na√Øve-bays. We also learned 3 models which are KNN, LC and SVM which are differently good in their own way. But for the best score accuracy LC is the best algorithm. We also learn different libraries like scikit-learn etc. which helps these models to get the best accuracy score by testing and training the data.
